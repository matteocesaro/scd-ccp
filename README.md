I am glad to share the project: ‘CLIMATE CHANGE PERCEPTION EVOLUTION’.

We have worked on a semantic change detection task in order to understand how the evolution of #climatechange perception has evolved in the last thirty years.

We divided the problem into two tasks:
1. Diachronic task: the aim of the diachronic task is to compare and measure how perceptions of the Climate Change topic vary over time. 
2. Task comparing different media:  the aim of this task is instead to analyze the variation of the Climate Change topic considering different sources (Blog and Newspaper).

In our analysis, we considered the distributional hypothesis(the context in which a word is applied influences and defines its meaning, so comparing word distributions gives indications of the semantic distance between them.) and word embedding representation of words using the corpus called ‘Corpus of Contemporary American English’.

We have analyzed the entity disambiguation issue by using GENRE.

Subsequently we have trained the model using the compass aligned distributional embeddings (CADE).

The results of the analysis show that the urgency of the problem is perceived globally. 
The perception of climate change has evolved and changed over the years especially on the causes and impact of the phenomenon.
While in the blogs the considerations on climate change are related to the impact on a social level, the newspapers refer mainly to the effect that the topic has on politics.
