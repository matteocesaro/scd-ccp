I am glad to share the project: ‘CLIMATE CHANGE PERCEPTION EVOLUTION’.

We have worked on a semantic change detection task in order to understand how the evolution of #climatechange perception has evolved in the last thirty years.

In our analysis, we considered the #distributionalhypothesis and #wordembedding representation of words using the corpus called ‘Corpus of Contemporary American English’.

We have analyzed the entity disambiguation issue by using GENRE.
Subsequently we have trained the model using the compass aligned distributional embeddings (CADE).
